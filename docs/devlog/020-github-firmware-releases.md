# 020: GitHub firmware releases

## Goal

Make each validated Metronome firmware version downloadable from the GitHub
project page as the same merged image used by M5Burner.

## Design

The release workflow is triggered by a project-qualified
`metronome-vX.Y.Z` tag. It rejects malformed tags and versions that differ
from `VERSION`, then calls the existing M5Burner packaging script. GitHub's
built-in token and CLI create a release with the merged binary and its SHA-256
checksum; no additional repository secret or third-party release action is
needed.

Tagging remains after the hardware gate. This keeps the physical-device and
M5Burner checks explicit while automating the reproducible build and public
download step.

## Verification

```text
just package-m5burner
cd dist/m5burner
sha256sum --check metronome-m5stickc-plus2-v0.1.0.bin.sha256
```

The first end-to-end GitHub validation target is pushing a matching
`metronome-vX.Y.Z` tag after the next hardware-approved version.

## Hardware observations

No new hardware behavior is introduced. Existing display, click playback,
controls, and M5Burner burn checks remain the release gate.
